This example demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in COBOL programs involving the use of the CURRENT-DATE and CURRENT-TIME functions.  The program attempts to store the current date and time into fields that are not large enough to hold the full values. This can cause data truncation and lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior. The solution involves enlarging the receiving fields to correctly accommodate the full date and time values returned by the functions.  This highlights the importance of carefully considering data sizes when working with built-in functions to prevent subtle bugs.
